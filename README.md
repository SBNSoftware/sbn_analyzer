Charged-current $\nu_\mu$ interaction analysis with two detected protons (CC2p)

Analysis of charged-current neutrino interactions. This repository is mainly divided into:

- [`GeneratorAnalysis/`](https://github.com/afropapp13/sbn_analyzer/tree/main/GeneratorAnalysis): contains scripts analysing events generated by different simulators.
- [`CAFAnaAnalysis/`](https://github.com/afropapp13/sbn_analyzer/tree/main/CAFAnaAnalysis): contains scripts analysing experiment data using the CAFAna framework.

Plots generated through the scripts in both directories are placed under [`Figs/`](https://github.com/afropapp13/sbn_analyzer/tree/main/Figs). 

# Setting up

If it is the first time working in this repository, you have to run

```bash
source setup.sh
```

to set up the correct feature branch of `sbnana` used in this codebase. Once this is done, you have to run

```bash
source activate.sh
```

to activate your local `sbnana` build every time you start a new terminal. This will also setup ROOT, so that you can run scripts in both `GeneratorAnalysis/` and `CAFAnaAnalysis/`.
