# CC1muAnalysis

Analysis of charged-current neutrino interactions. This repository is mainly divided into:

- [`GeneratorAnalysis/`](https://github.com/epelaaez/CC1muAnalysis/tree/main/GeneratorAnalysis): contains scripts analysing events generated by different simulators.
- [`CAFAnaAnalysis/`](https://github.com/epelaaez/CC1muAnalysis/tree/main/CAFAnaAnalysis): contains scripts analysing experiment data using the CAFAna framework.

Plots generated through the scripts in both directories are placed under [`Figs/`](https://github.com/epelaaez/CC1muAnalysis/tree/main/Figs). And code for a LaTeX note summarizing the project is under [`LaTeX/`](https://github.com/epelaaez/CC1muAnalysis/tree/main/LaTeX).
