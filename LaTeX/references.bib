    abstract = {Starting from the basic interactions between photons, pions, nucleons and isobars we reconstruct a standard model providing an adequate description of the γN→πN reaction. With this, and the ph, Δh effective interactions used with success in the pion-nuclear reactions, we develop a systematic many-body expansion in the number of ph excitations in the nucleus up to 3p3h excitations in a single step, where convergence was found in the related pion-nuclear problem. We evaluate total photonuclear cross sections in different nuclei which compare rather favorably with experiment. The method allows for a separation of the γ absorption and the (γ, π) cross sections and they are also evaluated here.}

The objective is to provide as accurate  as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of  reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those  where strong interactions play a rôle, directly or indirectly, and  therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then  not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the  program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and  various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for  areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers,  underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much  more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program  elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle  and process data. This should allow the user to tailor the generation task  to the topics of interest.

The goal of the project is to develop a ‘canonical’ neutrino interaction physics Monte Carlo whose validity extends to all nuclear targets and neutrino flavors from MeV to PeV energy scales. Currently, emphasis is on the few-GeV energy range, the challenging boundary between the non-perturbative and perturbative regimes, which is relevant for the current and near future long-baseline precision neutrino experiments using accelerator-made beams. The design of the package addresses many challenges unique to neutrino simulations and supports the full life-cycle of simulation and generator-related analysis tasks. GENIE is a large-scale software system, consisting of ∼120000 lines of C++ code, featuring a modern object-oriented design and extensively validated physics content. The first official physics release of GENIE was made available in August 2007, and at the time of the writing of this article, the latest available version was v2.4.4.}

Neutrinos and antineutrinos with energy in the range 30--300 GeV were produced in the 1982 Fermilab narrow-band neutrino beamline. A total of 35 000 neutrino and 7000 antineutrino interactions were recorded in the CCFR detector located in LabE. The incident neutrino flux was determined by methods similar to those used in previous experiments. The rate of increase with energy of the total cross section ($\sigma$/Ev) in the range 30 to 75 GeV was determined to be 0.659{\textpm}0.005(stat){\textpm}0.039(syst){\texttimes}10−38 cm2/GeV and 0.307{\textpm}0.008(stat){\textpm}0.020(syst){\texttimes}10−38 cm2/GeV for incident neutrinos and antineutrinos, respectively. The 5.9{\%} systematic errors are due primarily to uncertainties in the flux intensity measurement. The energy dependence of the cross section in the regionE$\nu$=100--300 GeV was found to be linear, as determined by relative normalization techniques. A weighted average of our previous and present measurement for the total $\nu$-N cross section yields:{\$}{\$}{\backslash}begin{\{}gathered{\}}  {\backslash}sigma (vN) = 0.666 {\backslash}pm 0.020(statistical {\backslash}hfill {\backslash}{\backslash}              + systematic)E{\_}v 10^{\{} - 38{\}} cm^2 ; {\backslash}hfill {\backslash}{\backslash}  {\backslash}sigma ({\backslash}bar vN) = 0.324 {\backslash}pm 0.014(statistical {\backslash}hfill {\backslash}{\backslash}              + systematic)E{\_}v 10^{\{} - 38{\}} cm^2 ; {\backslash}hfill {\backslash}{\backslash} {\backslash}end{\{}gathered{\}} {\$}{\$}.},

In this article I first describe the theoretical basis and the approximations needed to get to any of the generators. I also discuss the strengths and limitations of theoretical models used to describe semi-inclusive neutrino-nucleus reactions. I then confront present day’s generators with this theoretical basis by detailed discussions of the various reaction processes. Finally, as examples, I then show for various experiments results of the generator GiBUU for lepton semi-inclusive cross sections as well as particle spectra. I also discuss features of these cross sections in terms of the various reaction components, with predictions for Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment. Finally, I argue for the need for a new neutrino generator that respects our present-day knowledge of both nuclear theory and nuclear reactions and is as much state-of-the-art as the experimental equipment. I outline some necessary requirements for such a new generator.}
